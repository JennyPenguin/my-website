          <p>This was my very first VR project. Originally, I planned on creating a cherry blossom forest that people
            can walk in. I love cherry blossom and it's one of my life goals before I die to walk in a real one. After I
            shared this idea with my mom, she was very excited, and she told me that it would be great to use VR to not
            fulfill our life dreams but also life regrets. That's when we came up with the idea of a memory collider
            filled with cherry blossoms, roses, and many more together. The central goal is to fulfill one of my mom's
            biggest regret - not having a proper wedding - using scenes in VR.</p>

          <p>During the summer of 2023, I attended a UC Berkeley summer camp where I made this project together with Himani Jha and Carlos Yam-Gomez using Snap!. I then transferred the project to Scratch to publish it (due to large memory size). The original link is: <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/871226876/">https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/871226876/</a>.</p>
